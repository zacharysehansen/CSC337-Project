CSC 337 Final Project: Pocket Pond
Team: Jordan Demler,Sameeka Maroli, Zachary Hansen
Description: Pocket Pond is a fun and engaging web-based game where players build and manage their own aquarium. Players start with a single fish, 
which they can feed and pet to earn coins. Coins can be spent in the shop to purchase new fish.The game includes a leaderboard that ranks players 
based on the value of their fish, allowing them to visit the aquariums of the top players. With dynamic animations, a health bar to monitor fish 
well-being, and an interactive shop system. The combination of playful graphics, smooth user interactions, and competitive features makes Pocket 
Pond a delightful experience for players of all ages.
